## Intro
`screen on an intro page or the Indra GitHub page?`  
Hi everyone. This is a tutorial video for the Indra system which is an agent-based modeling system written in python.
In this video, we will show you how to create an ABM model.

## Presentation of forest fire model
First, we will represent the forest fire model to show how a runnable model work.  
`screen switch to forest_fire.py file and run the model`

## Transformation from basic to segregation
`type [cp models/basic.py tutorial/basic.py] in terminal to create basic.py`  
`screen switch to IDE/Vim`
We will modify a prototype model(basic model basic.py) 
into a real segregation model step by step to show that new developers don't have to start from scratch.

### Step1

### Step2
`screen on IDE/Vim to edit code`  
Basically there are mainly two things you need to define in your new model. The agent first surveys the environment. 
The second is to respond to the result of that survey. So we need to define a function (we call agent_action in ABM
system) to show how the agent surveys the environment and the response to the result.  
`start changing codes (changes are the difference between basic_step_one.py and basic_step_two.py)`  
TODO: script while coding
