# The Origin of Money: An Agent-Based Model of Carl Menger's Theory

Eugene Callahan and Peiwen Tang

## Introduction

Carl Menger famously, in his 1892 paper, "On the Origin of Money,"
offered an *emergent phenomenon*
theory of how humans came to employ a *medium of exchange* (money) for most
transactions: it is unlikely, he held, that people with no experience with some
good gradually *emerging* as a medium of exchange could simply invent money *ab
nihilo*. Instead, one good would, over time, come to be understood as widely
exchangeable: and that recognition, in itself, would make the good a more
attractive acquisition in future possible exchanges.

But Menger went further, and analyzed *why* certain goods were particularly
suited to take on the role of medium of exchange. Such properties as
*divisibility*, *durability*, and *ease of transport* would all increase the
likelihood that a good would emerge as a medium of exchange.

It is not easy to test a theory like Menger's: it is unlikely that society will
allow the interested scientist to wipe clean all members knowledge of a money
and wait to see if a medium of exchange spontaneously emerges. (Examples like
the WWII POWs who used cigarettes as money are somewhat tarnished by the fact
that such prisoners already had experience with using money.) However,
*agent-based models* (ABMs), while certainly not real societies, can be
programmed so that the *agents* they contain "act like" real economic agents in
some important respects. And, as a leading tool in exploring emergent
phenomena, it seems appropriate to use an ABM as a way to explore the
plausibility of Menger's theory.

## The World in the Model

An initial question that may strike the reader is, "Of what relevance 
could a simple computer model have for examining a historical hypothesis
about what occurred in the real world?" We point such a reader to Mary 
Morgan's work *The World in the Model*. Morgan in her book states how models can 
help to combine the economists narrative expression to an expression with numbers, logic and step:  "Writing down a model and manipulating it allows economists to think through in a consistent and logical way how a number of variables might interrelate, and
to find solutions to questions about such systems. This habit of making and
using models extends the powers of the mind to ask questions and explore the
answers in complicated cases.

## Menger's Theory

Started from the basic thinking that *a commodity should be given up by its
owner in exchange for another more useful to him*, Menger looks back to the
"uncoined state“, Menger traces the entities that were serves as a mean of
exchange, and discovers the causes behind the evolution from goods to money.
 
The intuitive thinking on pursuing trading is that one would like to seek for
the opportunity to exchange in order to acquire what he/she directly want, and
reject those are sufficiently supplied and not directly needed. However, such
thinking would result to very limited number of bargains, because in reality,
there are little chances that the factors of needed items meet: it is difficult
to realize immediate barter as supply and demand do not always quantitatively
coincide.

Menger sees one underlying factor which stimulates trading: the different
degrees of salebleness of commodities. He also pointed out an error in
economics, that at it is incorrect to assume that *all commodities, at a
definite point of time and in given market, may be mutually exchanged in
definite quantities at will.* Menger sees that trading can hardly just follow
our willingness, and there exists an gap between wholesale price and retail
price in reality, that we are likely to bear a loss when selling an item
compared to the cost at the time we purchase the same entity. However, as long
as we can minimize the loss the we bear, we are more willing to obtain the
item, no matter if the item is immediately needed by us.
 
Consequently, the easiness of disposing the goods can greatly determines the
salebleness. The following circumstances and limits Menger listed are factors
that influence the degree of salebleness of goods, and they include buyers’ own
interest (which can hardly be quantified by our model), goods’ characteristics
(what we want to focus on), and external factors (which are hard to be
implemented in our model). 
 
Circumstances that affects the degrees of salebleness:

1. number of persons in want of the item, and the extent and intensity of their want
2. purchasing power
3. available quantity in relation to the want of the goods
4. divisibility
5. development of the market (speculation)
6. number of the limitations (regulation)

Spatial limits of saleableness:

1. By the degree to which the want of the commodities is distributed in space.
2. By the degree to which the goods lend themselves to transport, and the cost of transport incurred in proportion to their value.
3. By the extent to which the means of transport and of commerce generally are developed with respect to different classes of commodities.
4. By the local extension of organised markets and their inter-communication by “arbitrage.”
5. By the differences in the restrictions imposed upon commercial
inter-communication with respect to different goods, to interlocal and, in
particular, in international trade.

Time limits of saleableness:

1. By permanence in the need of them (their independence of fluctuation in the same).
2. Their durability, i.e., their suitableness for preservation.
3. The cost of preserving and storing them. 
4. The rate of interest.
5. The periodicity of a market for the same.
6. The development of speculation and in particular of time bargains in connection with the same.
7. The restrictions imposed politically and socially on their being transferred from one period of time to another.

With the idea of salebalness, the mean of exchange is pushed to the next level.
Under the above listed circumstances and limits, goods are divided into two
categories: something one directly wants, or, something can be exchanged. When
any one has brought goods not highly saleable to market, the idea uppermost in
his mind is to exchange them. One reason is that the goods cannot be directly
used by him/her. But another intriguing reason why one chose to purchase the
item is that someone else may want it. As saleableness of goods encounter both
objective (i.e. goods’ characteristics) and subjective (i.e. personal interest)
factors, it can be greatly different for each one, and thus different people
can have different levels of willingness to purchase/sell a goods.

*These wares would be qualified by their costliness, easy transportability, and
fitness for preservation (in connection with the circumstance of their
corresponding to a steady and widely distributed demand), to ensure to the
possessor a power, not only “here” and “now” but as nearly as possible
unlimited in space and time generally, over all other market-goods at economic
prices.*
 
Such thinking promotes barter, and at the end of the day, one can likely get
what he/she wants after multiple exchanges.
During the process of trading, with goods’ different saleableness, they could
be differentiated into “money” and the rest: for means of “money”, we can see
the pattern of maintaining or even increasing of their originally high
saleableness; for those less saleable goods, there would be decreasing chances
for them to be bartered.
 
Precious metal is a significant means of exchanges hitherto, and it’s a good
example of money under the theory of saleableness. Regarding to the three key
underlying factors of salebleness, precious metal’s own characteristics cover
all of them superbly:

- Divisibility: The homogeneity of precious metal easily allows people to
control the quality and weight when dividing with, without having unequal means
of value on each portion;
- Durability: Precious metal has almost ultimate durability and has little cost while preserving it;
- Transportability: It is well distributed geographically, and with the
advantage of its homogeneity, precious metal has low cost of transportation
(because even for those heavier ones, we can divide it and carry a small
chunk).

Additionally, it’s not just the (spatial and time) ease of trading, but the low cost of converting precious metal, including the spending on preserving and transporting it, stipulates precious metal to become an optimal choice of money.

## Critiques of Menger

With the thoery of the emergence of money from Menger with bare provement and pure theory in the paper, critics continued to devotes their own thinking towards Menger's theory. Hodegson in his 2006 paper, "Carl Menger's theory of the evolution of money: some problems," questioned Menger's neglect on the importance of state and government in the process of the emergence of money, stating that both are playing an important role during, not as what Menger has described "(emgerence of money is) analogous to natural selection." Specifically on precious metal, as a form of money, Hodgson also proposed his concern on potential adulteration, stating that "The main problem with Menger's theory is that, given potential quality variation, the spontaneous process of evolution of the monetary unit may break down, possibly requiring the intervention of the state or central bank to maintain the currency unit." The concern on faking money further assists his central idea on the importance of the government intervention during the emgerence of money. 

Similar to Hodegson, during an interview in 2011 topic on "What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber", Graber also proposed his doubt on mainstream idea of the emergence of money, but from a different perspective. Graber first refutes the common thinking of the process of having barter system, then money, and then arrival of credit and debit, then proposed his discovery of "Credit and debt comes first, then coinage emerges thousands of years later and then, when you do find 'I’ll give you twenty chickens for that cow' type of barter systems, it’s usually when there used to be cash markets."

Ikeda in his 2008 paper, "Carl Menger’s monetary theory: A revisionist view," backs Menger's theory by stating that "according to Menger, a sound monetary system does not require legal sanctions, and is not predicated upon the explicit agreement of market participants. On the other hand, Menger argues that the state may have played a role in overcoming the difficulties of using metal as an exchange commodity." Having Hodgson insisting on the importance of state regulation in the emergence of money, here we can see that from the chronological-order perspective, Ikeda emphasizes that we can first have the money emerge spontaneously, then we need to have the government intervention to do things like quality control. Ikeda does not place government in a key position during the emergence of money, refering to Menger's idea that "although it is possible for government to compel market participants to accept certain kinds of money, this does not mean that market participants will be pleased to accept them."

Ikeda concludes that "the merits of indirect exchange were not discovered by everyone simultaneously", so we can see unordered trading behavior during the early stage of trading - it is hard to tell which good pops out, but after a period of time and enough rounds of trading between agents, the suitable media of exchange will emerge. 

Robert Murphy, too, in his 2011 paper, "Have Anthropologists Overturned Menger?" challenges the historical facts proposed by Graeber, proposing that "at least in the Misesian exposition, the original state of pure, direct exchange — where people just exchanged in order to obtain goods that they directly valued — would last very briefly." He also states that Graeber's disagreement on barter system stands on his failure of finding "written record" on barter pricing, which is not solid enough in Murphy's point of view. Murphy further examples the cigarettes exchange in prison, as a spontaneous money emergence without debt and credit comes first.

Having the refute from Ikeda and Murphy on Hodegson and Graeber, the concern on the impact of adulteration and the description on credit and debt are both worth further modeling and testing in addition to Menger's money theory. In the future Agent-based modeling, new attributes like doable of adulteration of the goods could involved and tested to see how it will impact the evolvement of money, and the action of credit could be added as a new type of trading action used between agents together with direct exchange (which is what we have now). 


## Translating Menger into an Agent-Based Model

Why we reduced Menger's criteria to only three factors.

- Each "Menger factor" can be turned on or off.
- We track how many times each good trades.
- A good "becomes money" as it comes close to being 
  one side of every trade.

Divisibility: homogeneous
in terms of standard unit

## The Design of Our Model

- Elements and Functionalities
    
    Our model is primarily in `money.py` with supporting generic economic
    functions in `trade_utils.py`.
    In our model, we apply three main
    factors mentioned in Carl Menger's essay, *On the Origins of Money*. Each
    attribute for each good is represented in a decimal number greater than
    zero and less and equal to one. 

    - **Divisibility** identifies how seperatable a good is. A cow is less divisible than a chunk of gold because if a cow is cut into a half, it's not tradeable anymore as a livestock. Smaller the number, more divisible the good. 
    - **Durability** determines how long an item can be stored. Foods are generally less durable than metals, and the decayed food would be less valuable than the fresh ones. Goods like livestock have their own lifespans, and if a cow is dead, it is unlikely to be traded in the market. Having a durability close to 1 meaning that the good is very durable, not easily corrupted (like diamond). 
    - **Transportability** shows whether an item is easy to be carried. It's easy for us to carry some avocados but not milk because milk could be split out while avocados can be put in anywhere. 
These three key attributes will determine which good is likely to emergence into money in the process of trading. 

    In our model, the nature holds 8 different goods, each having 10 units. The
    user can choose at most 8 agents to trade with each other, and each "Menger
    factor" can be turned on or off so that the user can view the effect of
    each attribute on the number of trades (**?? and user can also choose
    whether to give all units of one item to one agent or allocate the number
    randomly**). We track the numbers how many times each good trades, and the
    most traded good becomes money. In our model, *utility*, how eager a trader
    wants to own the good, is a representation of the *value* of a good. For
    each agent, when trading, only when gaining the offered good can provide a
    larger utility than losing the good he/she holds can continue the trade.
    Otherwise, this offer will be rejected by the agent or the agent may ask
    for more units. We have line graph representing the trend of number of
    trades for each good and once the trade is idle for **(?? 4 to be
    changed)** periods, there will be an alert that the equilibrium in our
    environment may be reached, meaning that maybe there will be no trade
    happened during the following periods, reminding the user that the current
    result is likely to be the final result. 

- Design Process 
    - Utility Function
        
        Utility is our important determinate for a trader to accept or reject
        an offer, and it is a representation of the value of a good - only when
        the trader wants to own the good and worth losing the good being
        requested is the offered good valuable. We initially used a linear
        utility function.

        ```python
        def gen_util_func(qty):
            return max_util - qty
        ```

        The *max_util* can be set by the model. However, the law of
        **Diminishing Marginal Utility** states that "all else equal as
        consumption increases the marginal utility derived from each additional
        unit declines" (Gossen's First Law *citation needed*). So, we updated
        our utility function.

        ```python
        def gen_util_func(qty):
            return max_util * (DIM_UTIL_BASE ** (-qty))
        ```

        The use of exponential function makes our utility function fit closer to the real-life trading.
        **?? MAX_UTIL AND DIM_UTIL_BASE TO BE TESTED**

    - Offering and Responding
        
        During one trade, we have one an initiator offering one good (*good A*)
        at a time and a receiver being asked to trade one good (*good B*). The
        initiator starts with offering one unit of *good A*, which is the
        divided amount of that good (one times the divisibility of that good). 

        For the receiver, he/she will evaluate the utilities of gaining *good
        A* and losing *good B*. If the gain (the utility of getting *good A*)
        is smaller than the loss (the absolute value of the utility of losing
        *good B*), the receiver will tell the initiator that the offered amount
        of *good A* is inadequate so that that the initiator can increase the
        amount offered. The receiver can re-determine the gain and loss with
        the new amount. If the initiator offers all the available amount but
        the receiver thinks that he/she still can't gain utility, the trade
        will be rejected. If the gain is larger than the loss, the receiver
        will wait for the initiator to evaluator his/her gain and loss. If both
        parties can achieve larger gain than loss, the receiver will accept the
        offer, meaning that the trade is made. Our record will increment the
        trade_count of the both goods by one. Otherwise, if the initiator can't
        gain in this trade, he/she will reject the trade because the receiver
        is always trading with one unit of good, meaning that there's no room
        to increase the amount. 

        The initiator will loop through all the available goods he/she has to seek trades.

    - Randomization in Trading
        
        During the implementation of our divisibility attribute, we found that the first good of the natures_good dictionary is always traded the most. We solved the problem by using these two lines of code:
        ```python
        goods_list = list(goods_dict.keys())
        good = random.choice(goods_list)
        ```
        so that the first good in the dictionary will not have the priority when endowed to the agents by the nature.
    **TODO**
    - Implementation of Durability
    - Transportability and Grid
- Attributes that not being applied (having similarities with our current elements)

## Results


One realization we gained from our modeling efforts is that "transportability"
is a two-way street: it only helps to have a good that can be transported a
long ways when the good you want in exchange can *also* be transported a long
ways. There is no sense sending your gold from New York to South Carolina
for paw-paws, since the paw-paws won't make it back.

Another facet of transportability that became apparent during our experiments
is that transportability only becomes important for agents engaged in
long-distance trade. When we set our agents' trading neighborhoods to a small
size, transportability disappeared as a factor.

[Here we will discuss experiments with different parameters and so on.]
- Isolation of Durability
When a good is too decayed, its `amt_avaliable` will be set to zero by using the followinng code:

```python
if math.exp(-(1-trader["goods"][good]["durability"]) *
           (trader["goods"][good]["age"]/10)) &lt; 0.0001:
            trader["goods"][good][AMT_AVAIL] = 0
```
Without this adjustment on `amt_avaliable`, when only applying the
functionality of durability, we see that gold is traded very often (which is
not surprising), but banana and milk are also extensively traded. The reason is
that when these two items are too decayed, their utility delta will be very
similar, and a lot of tradings will be exculsively between them, while gold,
having a very optimal utility delta, can be too good for the banana holders to
trade for.

## Conclusion

Our efforts are certainly not an attempt to "prove" Menger's theory of the
origin of money is correct, if such a thing is even possible. Rather, the fact
that Menger's theory can be implemented in a formal system, such as an ABM,
instead is only put forward as increasing its plausibility: if the theory
"works" in the simplified world of our model, then the possibility it reflects
how money really emerged is made more likely.
